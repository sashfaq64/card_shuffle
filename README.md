# card_shuffle
This program is supported by the Qt framework. To build, download all files in repository and run via  QT Creator. Select kit(s) in order to run the program on your machine of choice.

The goal of this exercise is to build a stand–alone program that will allow a user to display images of the standard 52–card deck of French–suited playing cards. The graphical user interface supports two things: The layout of all 52 cards of the deck, and three buttons that the user can use to control the GUI: the Shuffle button, the Reset button, and the Quit button.
